I began seriously practicing C++ in Nov. 2024 and wanted to start a portfolio for the projects I have done since I believe a lot of the key concepts and structures of the code are practiced here.

**Currently I have about 100 hours of C++ experience.**  If you have any questions/comments please reach out!
