Take a look at tic_tac_toe, rock_paper_scissors_, and Text_adventure.  I had the most fun with those three projects.  In some of the folders you will see a base version and then a more advanced version.

C++ was the first programming language I ever learned, dating back to 2015 during my college years. As of November 2024, I have picked it up again and decided to create a portfolio to track and showcase some of the projects I have worked on. I believe the codes I have written show a lot of the key concepts, structures, and foundations making them valuable.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out!
