I began seriously practicing C++ in Nov. 2024 and wanted to start a portfolio for the projects I have done since I believe a lot of the key concepts and structures of the code are practiced here.

If you have any questions/comments please reach out!

My experience as of Nov. 16, 2024:
96 hours spent coding C++
