C++ was the very first language that I ever learned.  I began back in 2015 during college.  Today, as of Nov. 2024, I picked it back up again and wanted to start a portfolio for the projects I have done since I believe a lot of the key concepts and structures of the code are practiced here.

If you have any questions/comments please reach out!
